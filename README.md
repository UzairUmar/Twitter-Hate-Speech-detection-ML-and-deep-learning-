# Twitter-Hate-Speech-detection-ML-and-deep-learning-

This project was part of course 67212 "Natural Language processing in Python". 
Binary text classifcation was done on Twitter data (collected from Kaggle) and a model was trained using Machine and Deep learning methods.
Feature Engineering was used to extract key features from dataset.
Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear SVC were used as Machine learning models.
Bi-directional RNN was used as deep learning model.
Standard metrics(Accuracy, Precision, F1 and Recall) were used to calculate the performances of respective models.
